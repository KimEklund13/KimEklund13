ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kim!

Iâ€™m interested in:
- Test Automation
- Crypto 
- Stonks
- Weightlifting while listening to crypto and stock market news like an insufferable bro

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my skill set in Selenium and Appium automation using Python
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that I vibe with. Got something with the word 'blockchain' in it?
